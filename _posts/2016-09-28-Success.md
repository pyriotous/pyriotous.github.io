title: Starting Conversations
---


When we started designing our shirts, the purpose was to say more than “we are against Trump” but to also say WHY.  As important,  we hoped that the shirts would start fun, reasoned, thoughtful discussions.  In wearing our shirts around Philadelphia, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and they really have started interpersonal interactions.  **Success!**  The shirts almost always get a second look, and the responses have run the gamut from “I don’t quite get it but I like it” to “I must have that shirt, it made my day, where can I buy it??”  These interactions have had a positive impact, allowing us to both share what we know about Trump and to hear what other people are thinking.  We hope to see these same responses and conversations happening around the country.  America needs it now!
