**Trump's Golden Pen:**
Ah yes, the
golden pen.  Did you know Trump often signs his name with a gold pen?
 Much like his branding tries to put a cheesy “gold” covering
over his bull$#!^, he seems to think a poorly veiled turd combined with
superlatives like “AMAZING!” is enough to fool people.  We aren't
fooled, and in our opinion his attempts end up looking something like
this.
