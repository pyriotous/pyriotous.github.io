**Donald Trump is a Demagogue:**  On the back of the shirt
is a list of the characteristics and methods of demagogues so everyone can
see and decided for themselves.  Clearly Trump isn't Hitler, but they are both 
demagogues and they both use the methods
of demagogues.  That scares us.  [Maybe: While Trump isn't as 
extreme as Hitler was, he shares 
Hitler's demagogue techniques.]
