    title: Donald Trump is a dangerous Demagogue
    more: "A demagogue is a political leader who seeks support by speaking to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument. Trump uses all of the common methods of a demagogue: Attacking the Media, Oversimplification, Personal Insults, Emotional Oratory, etc.  Well known demagogues include Hitler, Mussolini, etc. Do we want this type of character to be president?"
  - item: two
    title: Inspiring in-person conversations through T-shirts
    more: "We believe that the current presidential race is the most important race of our lifetimes.  We also believe that in-person conversations are far more likely to change someone's mind than online banter.   Our shirts  are bold yet approachable.  They invite a second look, and a conversation."

    caption: Our t-shirts speak out against the Trump candidacy.  They are fun, conversational, and slightly controversial.  Wearing them says not only that you don't support Trump's candidacy, but WHY!

    caption: This format allows us to develop real arguments and give reasoned explanations.  There's too little of that in the world now, so we try to avoid the name calling and let the truth prove its own power.
