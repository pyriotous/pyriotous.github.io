**Trump says what he thinks. Unfortunately!**
Nearly everything Trump says is false; so much so that even the 
media can't keep up.  We think the preponderance of quotes overwhelming 
this “golden poo” is similar to how Trump's own absurdity is overwhelming 
his campaign and the media.  Has he ever said anything real?
